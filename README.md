# Social Media Engagement Analysis (EDA + ML)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing social media engagement data using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Machine Learning techniques.  
The main objective is to identify key factors that influence engagement rate across different platforms, content types, posting behavior, and promotion strategies, and to build a predictive model for engagement rate.

## 📂 Project Files
- **Code.ipynb** – Complete EDA, visualization, preprocessing, feature engineering, and ML model implementation.
- **Social Media Engagement Dataset.csv** – Dataset used for analysis and modeling.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand how engagement varies across platforms and content categories.
- Analyze the relationship between followers and engagement rate.
- Compare weekday vs weekend engagement.
- Study the impact of posting time on likes, comments, and shares.
- Evaluate the effect of paid vs organic posts.
- Build a Machine Learning model to predict engagement rate.

## 🔍 EDA Tasks Performed
- Data structure and data type analysis  
- Missing value detection and handling  
- Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Feature engineering  
- Visual analysis using plots and charts  

### Key EDA Questions Answered
- How does engagement differ across content types?
- What is the relationship between followers and engagement?
- Does weekend posting increase engagement?
- Which posting time performs best?
- Do hashtags and caption length matter?
- Which platforms show the highest engagement?
- Does paid promotion improve engagement?
- How does sentiment affect engagement?

---

## 📊 Major Insights
- Product, Delivery, and Support content achieve higher engagement.
- Engagement rate decreases as follower count increases.
- Weekend posts perform slightly better than weekdays.
- Evening and Night posts perform better than Afternoon.
- Hashtags, caption length, and posting frequency show minimal impact.
- Organic posts outperform paid posts in engagement quality.
- Instagram and Facebook show higher average engagement.
- Negative sentiment receives higher engagement than positive.
